In this full stack project we will make a project management platform using PostgreSQL, Express JS, React JS and node JS. In this project management application you can manage the projects within an organization, create task in the projects and assign task to team members.

User can create multiple organizations and within an organization you can invite and manage the team members also. We have also integrated the email notifications in the project, whenever a new task is assigned then user will receive the email for that, and they will receive another reminder email also on due date of the task.

For user authentication and organization management we have used clerk, and to manage the background jobs like email notification and clerk webhooks management we have used Inngest in this full stack project.

we will use Neon PostgreSQL database to store user, organization, team members and projects data.

after building this project we will deploy it online using Vercel.
